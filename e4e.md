Ray tracing emits light from the camera onto the pixel plane and objects, and then back to the camera; creating realistic light effects with shadows.

## My Role in Eye 4 Eye
<br><br>
I worked as one of three designers for this game, for USC's Advanced Games Program. Unlike most of the other game projects, this was lead by mostly graduate students. In Eye 4 Eye, I worked as a designer, designing flowcharts in Miro and brainstorming with teammates explaining how puzzles would function. In addition to that, there was a lot of game design documentation, of which my parts will be posted below. We also oversaw playtests, took notes, and reported user feedback to improve our player experience. Additionally, we also had extensive communication with the Narrative, Programming, and Art teams, as we had to keep track of tying the story into the puzzles, making the puzzles and events functional, and keep track of assets. While my fellow designers were more involved in the playtesting part of the project, I did a little more level design, as I designed the tutorial levels and reworked them multiple times.
