## 3D projects

These projects are pretty old and I'm currently trying to find more recent projects. Made with Autodesk 123D and Maya!

## Thoughts on the Project
<br><br>
In this project I implemented a Phong shader with shadows and intersection checks. I actually used the Mollor Trombole algorithm for the triangle, as my Barycentric implementation ended up not working. While finding the final color of the object post shading, I also had to check whether a triangle or a sphere was closer to the light source and shade accordingly. I had a lot of trouble with the shadow code as well, but the many hours of work paid off.
