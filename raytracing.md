## Ray Tracing

**Project description:** 
<br><br>
In this project I implemented a Phong shader with shadows and intersection checks. I actually used the Mollor Trombole algorithm for the triangle, as my Barycentric implementation ended up not working. While finding the final color of the object post shading, I also had to check whether a triangle or a sphere was closer to the light source and shade accordingly. I had a lot of trouble with the shadow code as well, but the many hours of work paid off. 

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
