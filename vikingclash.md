## What I Did In Viking Clash

## My Role in Viking Clash
I worked as one of three designers for this game, for USC's Advanced Games Program and was easily the least experienced out of all of them. However, being on the Eye 4 Eye team has helped me level up a lot! 

Unlike most of the other game projects, this was lead by mostly graduate students. In Eye 4 Eye, I worked as a designer, designing flowcharts in Miro and brainstorming with teammates explaining how puzzles would function. In addition to that, there was a lot of game design documentation, of which my parts will be posted below. We also oversaw playtests, took notes, and reported user feedback to improve our player experience. Additionally, we also had extensive communication with the Narrative, Programming, and Art teams, as we had to keep track of tying the story into the puzzles, making the puzzles and events functional, and keep track of assets. While my fellow designers were more involved in the playtesting part of the project, I did a little more level design. I got to design the tutorial levels, rework them multiple times, and then build and decorate the lobby area where the tutorial takes place. Unfortunately, most of the decorations in the lobby I designed was replaced with store-bought assets, which though impressive looking, left the lobby area feeling a little too empty.
