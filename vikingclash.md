## My Role in Viking Clash
Viking Clash is the result of a semester long two-man project. Initially, Viking Clash was not going to be a fighting game, but rather an [arcade game](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B4EPx6QXChaFpN0UdeMY5bfNYbEYWEjRTJnM-p2NIXE/edit?usp=sharing) and then a game than included grappling hooks. However, the grappling hook prototypes were extremely buggy, and including grappling hooks in the said fighting game was definitely out of scope. Both previous iterations had a lot of brainstorming documents, so it's interesting to see the original idea compared to what it turned out to be. 

In this project, my partner and I made full use of [burndown charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xf16n5B3LCksBZkK2sHDASzsgOD7MUQrWBeGjnuNDL4/edit?usp=sharing) and a [game macro](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z5nIIFb3NxXMdv_BkHya_VmCUNcss2Xs4oNjKhUpkB4/edit?usp=sharing) in order to keep track of goals and progress. In this project, I programmed player movement, combat logic and physics, unique character kits, the HP system, UI, animated the characters, designed the stages, and managed audio as well. This was a fun and challenging project that helped me level up my programming skills!
