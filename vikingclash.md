## What I Did In Viking Clash

## My Role in Viking Clash
Viking Clash is the result of a semester long two-man project. Initially, Viking Clash was not going to be a fighting game, but rather an arcade game and then a game than included grappling hooks. However, the grappling hook prototypes were extremely buggy, and including grappling hooks in the said fighting game was definitely out of scope. 

In this project, my partner and I made full use of burndown charts(link) and a game macro(link) in order to keep track of goals and progress. In this project, I programmed player movement, combat logic and physics, unique character kits, the HP system, UI, animated the characters, designed the stages, and managed audio as well. This was a fun and challenging project and helped me level up my programming skills.
